# My first project upload

This project is really quite simple, but I still had fun with it. Using my love for video games, I wanted to make something that would output a random video game, a quote and a random filler message. The video game and quote are decided upon randomly based off of the input that a user provides; either "rpg" or "fps". for example - If a user inputs rpg, their game and quote are picked randomly from within the rpg object, and the same goes for if a user inputs fps.

This project was created using:
